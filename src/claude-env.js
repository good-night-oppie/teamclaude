// env)"` instead of launching claude directly. Pure and side-effect free so it
// can be unit-tested; the caller resolves the port, cert path, and holdSeconds.
//
// MITM (forward-proxy) mode is the default, matching `teamclaude run`: it routes
// ALL of claude's traffic through the proxy — even hardcoded api.anthropic.com
// endpoints (e.g. the design MCP) — with claude trusting our leaf via

// leaves other hosts alone.

// key gate, and setting it would drop Claude Code out of subscription mode (and
// its full model access). Remote clients that aren't on loopback must add the
// proxy key themselves.

// run` does: in MITM mode it rides in the proxy URL's userinfo and reaches the
// proxy as the CONNECT's Basic username; in base-URL mode it becomes a
// `/tc-acct/` prefix. TC_ACCT itself is then unset, so the pin does not leak
// into claude or anything it spawns — same reasoning as `run` deleting it from

/**
 * What a DIRECT launch must do about proxy variables it inherited.
 *
 * `--auto-fallback` promises to launch claude "directly, bypassing the proxy"
 * when the proxy is down — but the child inherits the parent's environment, and
 * the parent shell of a teamclaude session is usually one teamclaude itself set
 * up. So the traffic goes right back through a proxy, and the promise is broken
 * in one of two ways: the variable points at the port we JUST found dead, and
 * every request fails; or it points at some OTHER live proxy, and the session
 * silently runs somewhere the operator was told it would not. The second is the
 * worse one — a wrong destination reported as no destination.
 *
 * The rule is deliberately narrow. Clear only what is provably ours and provably
 * dead: a proxy variable pointing at loopback on the very port whose liveness we
 * just probed and lost. Anything else — a corporate egress proxy, a different
 * live teamclaude — is someone's deliberate configuration and is NOT deleted
 * behind their back; it is returned in `remaining` so the caller can qualify its
 * "direct launch" claim instead of lying about it. Reporting what we will not
 * touch is the same discipline splitRunArgs applies to misplaced flags.
 *
 * ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL is cleared unconditionally when it points at that dead
 * port: unlike the proxy vars it has exactly one meaning here, and leaving it
 * would send every request to a closed socket.
 *
 * Pure: takes an env object, returns a plan, mutates nothing.
