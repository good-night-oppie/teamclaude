// The launch preflight: decide, BEFORE `teamclaude run` spawns claude, whether
// the model the operator asked for can actually be served — and say so loudly.
//
// This module exists because of one asymmetry in Claude Code. At launch, a
// `--model` the client refuses is ADVISORY: the client warns in-band and
// silently falls back to its default. Not one of its warning call sites writes
// to stdout or stderr, and the process never aborts. So a session launched on a
// model nothing can serve is indistinguishable, from the outside, from a good
// one — it just quietly runs on something else, for hours, at another account's
// expense. (At runtime `/model x` is refused hard; only the launch path is
// silent, which is exactly the path a fleet launcher uses.) Nobody downstream
// will ever make this loud, so it has to be made loud here.
//
// The real incident this reproduces: a wrapper script emitted
//   run -- ... --model opus -n <session> --model deepseek-v4-pro
// Two `--model` flags, last one wins, and the winner was not a model id at all —
// it was the NAME OF A CONFIGURED ACCOUNT. Nothing produced a single line of
// output. Note what is NOT wrong here: the two flags are deliberate. Wrapper
// templates commonly append a default `--model` and document that caller args
// land after it, so the last flag winning is the override contract working as
// designed. The only fault was the winning VALUE — which is precisely why this
// module judges the winner and never the shape (see the asymmetry below).
//
// Pure and side-effect free: no fs, no process.env, no console, no clock. The
// caller loads the config, reads Claude Code's settings tiers, and prints. That
// keeps every decision here testable as data, which is the whole point — the
// duplicate-flag scan in particular is the sort of thing that is untestable and
// therefore wrong when it lives inside a command body.
//
// ── The blocking asymmetry, and why it is not an oversight ──
//
// A ROUTING failure BLOCKS the launch. Everything else WARNS. The verdicts have
// different epistemic standing:
//
//   * Routability is computed from teamclaude's OWN config with the very
//     predicates the router uses (model-namespace.js, pinned to
//     AccountManager's methods by a cross-product divergence test). When it says
//     "not routable" it is not predicting someone else's behaviour, it is
//     reporting its own — and it is deliberately built to say that only when it
//     can PROVE it (blocked by blockedModels; no eligible account; or an id that
//     is really an account name, excluded by the winning route, translated by
//     nobody, and headed for an account that talks to the real Anthropic API).
//     Every merely-unknown id stays routable, because teamclaude cannot tell a
//     future real Anthropic id from a typo and must not pretend to. A block on a
//     proof is safe; that narrowness is what earns it the right to block.
//   * The client allowlist is a model of a FOREIGN build that ships on its own
//     schedule, assembled from settings tiers we may not fully enumerate. A
//     false "denied" there would refuse a launch that works — a self-inflicted
//     outage caused by someone else's release. A false "allowed" merely leaves
//     the operator where they are today, with the client's own in-band warning
//     plus our stderr line. The costs are not symmetric, so neither is the rule.
//   * A DUPLICATE --model is a fact about the argv, not a proof about the
//     launch. Making it blocking was this module's worst bug and it is worth
//     recording why: a real launcher template appends `--model opus` to every
//     new session and documents that caller args land after it, so
//     `<wrapper> --model claude-fable-5` legitimately emits two flags and the
//     last one wins — exactly as intended. Blocking on the SHAPE would have
//     failed every model override on every session on that host, and such
//     sessions respawn automatically, so it would have failed repeatedly. The
//     duplicate is now reported loudly (with both values and the winner named)
//     and the decision to launch rests entirely on whether the WINNING value
//     can route, which is the part that can be proven. A guard against a silent
//     failure must never be able to cause a louder one.
//
// The one thing this preflight may never do is refuse a launch on rules that
// will not govern it. Two shapes of that were live and are now closed: a
// `--account` pin bypasses selection entirely (routes, models[] and `disabled`
// are never consulted for a pinned request, so they cannot justify a refusal),
// and a `--auto-fallback` launch with the proxy down never reaches teamclaude at
// all (so its routing table is not consulted either). Both are threaded in as
// parameters rather than assumed away.
//
// `--force` bypasses a block for the operator who knows better; `--strict`
// promotes the client warning to a block for the operator who wants the mirror
// treated as authoritative. Both are explicit, both are reported in the output
// so a transcript shows which posture was in effect, and both are teamclaude's
// own flags — they belong BEFORE the `--` separator, which is what the refusal
// line now says, because "pass --force" appended to the failing command line is
// not a working instruction.

 * Split `teamclaude run`'s arguments into teamclaude's own flags and the argv

 * (`teamclaude run --`): everything before it is ours, everything after it is
 * claude's, verbatim. With no separator the pre-existing behaviour is preserved
 * — teamclaude's flags are recognized and filtered out wherever they appear —
 * so `teamclaude run --no-mitm -p hello` keeps working. That is why the flag
 * names above have to stay distinctive: an unseparated launch cannot tell our
 * `--force` from a hypothetical claude `--force`.
 *
 * The `--` contract is NOT bent for our own flags: a `--force` after the
 * separator stays in claudeArgs, because "everything after -- is claude's,
 * verbatim" is the one promise this split makes and quietly eating three tokens
 * out of it would make the separator untrustworthy. It is instead REPORTED, via
 * `misplacedFlags`, so the caller can say where the flag belongs rather than
 * refusing twice with the same message.
 *
 * Pure, and returns the account token WITHOUT resolving it: name-vs-index
 * resolution needs the config, which is the caller's to load.
