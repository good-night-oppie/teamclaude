// The single owner of the truth "can this model id actually be served, and will
// the client even let it through". Three parties hold a partial copy of that
// truth today — Claude Code's `availableModels` allowlist, teamclaude's
// `routes[]`/`modelMap`/`models[]`, and whatever argv a launcher happens to
// emit — and every disagreement between them degrades silently: Claude Code
// warns in-band and falls back to its default without ever writing to stderr,
// so a launch with an unservable `--model` looks exactly like a good one. This
// module makes that verdict computable up front, in one place, so `run` can
// refuse loudly instead of running six minutes on the wrong model.
//
// Pure and side-effect free so it can be unit-tested: no fs, no network, no
// process.env, no console. The caller does all IO — it loads the config, reads
// Claude Code's settings tiers, and prints. Following src/model.js's leaf
// discipline it imports nothing but ./model.js, so it never pulls in the
// account-manager/server graph (and can therefore be imported from either).
//
// Two invariants this file exists to protect:
//
//   1. The namespace is NOT a finite list. It splits into an ENUMERABLE set
//      (modelMap keys, models[] claims — ids the config actually names) and an
//      UN-ENUMERABLE predicate (route globs; and every account with no custom
//      `upstream` passes arbitrary real Anthropic ids straight through). A
//      hand-written finite allowlist masquerading as the whole truth is exactly
//      the bug that caused this incident, so deriveNamespace() ships BOTH parts
//      plus the caveats, and routabilityOf() is the decidable predicate for any
//      id at all — including ones that appear nowhere in the config.
//
//   2. routabilityOf() must mirror account selection, not paraphrase it. Its
//      predicates are re-derivations of AccountManager._routeForModel /
//      _routeAllows / _accountOwnsModel and the [Nm]-tolerant modelMatches; the
//      accompanying test pins them to the real methods over a cross product of
//      models x accounts so the oracle and the request path cannot drift apart.
//
// Deliberately QUOTA-BLIND: routability is a static property of the config, so
// nothing here consults live quota, throttle holds, or rate-limit state. A
// `disabled` account is still reported (flagged), because "disabled" is an
// operator toggle a human can act on rather than transient health.
//
// clientAllowlistVerdict() models a FOREIGN gate — Claude Code 2.1.220's
// `Pl(model)` reading `settings.availableModels`. That build is not ours and
// will drift, so the verdict is ADVISORY and the implementation is
// deliberately ASYMMETRIC: it is faithful where the semantics are decidable
// from the id alone, and it BIASES TOWARD NOT BLOCKING everywhere else.
// Concretely, every branch of the real matcher that resolves a family alias
// through Claude Code's private tier-default table (which teamclaude cannot
// see) returns allowed=true with an "uncertain" reason rather than a denial.
// The asymmetry is chosen, not sloppy: a false "denied" makes teamclaude refuse
// a launch that would have worked — a self-inflicted outage — while a false
// "allowed" merely leaves the operator where they already are today, with
// Claude Code's own in-band warning. Cost of the two errors is not symmetric,
// so neither is the matcher.

// Deviations from the requested export shape, each justified where it is made:
//   * routabilityOf() returns routable=false in ONE case that bare eligibility
//     would call true — an id that is really a configured ACCOUNT name, is
//     excluded by the winning route, and is translated by no eligible account.
//     All three conditions are provable from the config, and "nothing can serve
//     it" is then literally true (it egresses verbatim and 404s). See the
//     comment at that branch; every other id keeps eligibility semantics.
//   * Its `route` is the normalized route plus an `index`, so a caller can say
//     WHICH route won — first-match means position is the whole story.
//   * `candidates` are ordered by priority (lowest value first, then config
//     order), mirroring _pickBestAvailable's primary key. Its secondary key is
//     the soonest quota reset, which is live state this module refuses to read,
//     so the first candidate is the static best guess and not a promise.
//   * The route/ownership predicates are exported alongside the three required
//     entry points so the test can pin them to AccountManager's own methods
//     (invariant 2) and so a future preflight/doctor reuses rather than recopies.

/**
 * Routability of `model` for a request PINNED to one account via /tc-acct — a

 *
 * A pinned request skips account selection entirely: forwardRequest indexes
 * `accountManager.accounts[ctx.pinnedIndex]` directly (server.js:536-537) and
 * never calls getActiveAccount, so NONE of _routeAllows, _accountOwnsModel or
 * `disabled` is consulted. Everything routabilityOf() can prove about the
 * unpinned path is therefore irrelevant here, and reusing it — which is what the
 * first cut of the preflight did — refuses launches the pin provably serves.
 *
 * What survives a pin, and is therefore all this can block on:
 *   * an unresolved pin — the proxy answers 404 locally (server.js:255-259), so
 *     EVERY request of that session fails;
 *   * blockedModels — the blocklist gate runs after the pin prefix is stripped
 *     (server.js:295), so it still rejects with a 400.
 * Everything else is reported as a warning, because the pinned account's own
 * upstream is the only thing that can answer "does this id work", and teamclaude
 * cannot see past it.

 * trim/lowercase/[1m]-strip; unshadowed bare-family-alias entries matched as
 * whole tokens; version-prefix entries on a '-' boundary, with the implicit
 * "claude-" retry). Everywhere the real matcher would consult Claude Code's
 * private alias table, this returns allowed=true with an "uncertain:" reason:
 * refusing a launch that would have worked is a far worse failure than passing
 * one the client will merely warn about in-band.
 *
 * Not modeled at all, and they do NOT all bias the same way — the honest
 * accounting, since a comment that waves at "the bias is intact" is how the
 * bias stops being checked:
 *   * settings `modelOverrides` reverse mapping — ADDITIVE. Ignoring it shrinks
 *     the effective allowlist and makes a FALSE DENIAL more likely. This is the
 *     dangerous direction, and it is the reason the verdict is advisory.
 *   * the server-supplied entitlement DENY set, and the fail-closed
 *     managed-policy preamble — SUBTRACTIVE. Ignoring them makes a false ALLOW
 *     more likely, which is the cheap direction.
 * The `--settings` tier is the one additive source that IS recovered: the
 * preflight reads it out of the argv it is judging and unions it in before
