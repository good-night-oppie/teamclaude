// Explain how one model id routes: the decision trace a request for that id
// would follow through the proxy, in the order the proxy actually evaluates it.
//
// The routing rules are spread across three places that never mention each
// other — the blocklist gate in server.js, the route/ownership predicates
// buried inside account *eligibility* in account-manager.js, and the
// post-selection modelMap rewrite in server.js — so "which account and which
// model id will actually serve this request" is currently answerable only by
// reading all three. That is how a config can silently route a model to an
// account that cannot serve it: nothing ever prints the decision. This module
// prints it.
//
// Pure and side-effect free (no fs, no fetch, no console, no clock) so it can
// be unit-tested and so `explainRouting` is trivially JSON-serializable for a
// `--json` flag; `formatExplain` owns all presentation. It takes a plain config
// object — the same shape `loadConfig()` returns — and never constructs an
// AccountManager, so it cannot mutate live routing state.
//
// This module NARRATES a decision it does not make. Every predicate that decides
// anything — route normalization, first-match, [Nm]-tolerant claim matching,
// ownership, exclusivity, the blocklist — is imported from ./model-namespace.js,
// which owns the single copy and pins it to AccountManager's own methods with a
// cross-product divergence test. An explanation that could disagree with the
// router would be worse than none, so the two cannot be separately edited: what
// is local here is presentation and the reason STRINGS, never a verdict.
//
// The trace is deliberately QUOTA-BLIND: it answers "what does this config
// mean", not "what is healthy right now". Every runtime-only factor (quota
// utilization, throttle holds, error status, ephemeral route pins, session
// affinity) is reported as an explicit unknown in `notes` rather than guessed.

// ── the launch line ─────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * ONE line describing where this launch's traffic will actually go, for
 * `teamclaude run` to print on EVERY launch — not only when something is wrong.
 *
 * This is the cheapest guard in the module and, for the incident that motivated
 * all of it, the most reliable one. The preflight can only object to what it can
 * prove is broken; it is silent whenever routing merely differs from what the
 * operator assumed. That silence is the actual failure mode: a session ran six
 * minutes on the wrong model and the only signal existed inside the client's own
 * transcript, where nobody looks. A launch that always states its destination
 * makes the whole class visible without a veto, without forking another
 * program's private logic, and without any power to refuse valid work.
 *
 * Deliberately one line. A paragraph here would be scrolled past on every launch
 * and would train operators to ignore exactly the line that matters; `teamclaude
 * explain <model>` exists for the full trace, and this line names it.
 *
 * Quota-blind like the rest of the module: it reports the FIRST candidate the
 * config implies, which is the account a fresh request tends to get, and says
 * how many others stand behind it. Live quota can reorder that at request time
 * (see the trace notes), so the line describes the config, never the moment.
 *
 * Pure: returns the string, never prints it, and is written so that no input can
 * make it throw — the caller still guards, because a launch must never fail
 * because its narration did.
